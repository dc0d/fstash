**raw ideas** which might or might not get implemented:

- ❌ generate json config for current directory - indicating list of files and list of template files
- ✅ stash current directory
- ✅ pop a stash
- ❌ avoid overwriting (alarm and ask) or diff
- ❌ stash files from different directories
- ❌ use semver
- ❌ diff stash
- ❌ share stash from device to device
- ❌ sample stash server
- ❌ multiple stashes in one directory (or multiple directories)
- ❌ embedded KVStore (based on positive)
